## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. **No Additional Setup Required! ✨**

**Database Replication NOT needed!**

We use **Supabase Broadcast** instead of Database Replication, which means:
- ✅ Works on free tier
- ✅ No dashboard configuration
- ✅ Available immediately
- ✅ Better performance

See [REALTIME_SOLUTION.md](./REALTIME_SOLUTION.md) for technical details.

### 2. **Start the App**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. **Test the Feature**
1. Login with any user account
2. Click "Projects" in the navbar
3. Create a new project
4. Add tasks to the project
5. Invite another user (use another browser/incognito to test)
6. Drag tasks between columns
7. Watch realtime updates!
